## Project Introduction
The coordinates of the editing region on the genome are located according to the first 100 bp sequence of the editing region uploaded by the user. At the same time, we also compared the first 100 bp sequence of the editing region uploaded by the user with blast sequence, so this project can accurately and quickly complete the positioning of the editing region on the genome.
